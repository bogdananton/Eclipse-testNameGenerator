Eclipse Plugin that converts a phrase intro a PHPUnit test method.<br/>

Usage
----
Move the cursor to the line that you want to convert into a test method and press the keybind.

The default key bind is **Ctrl+Shift+8**<br/>
If you want to change the key bindings, open Window / Preferences / General / Editors / Keys, search for "*PHPUnit Generate Test Method using phrase*" and change the keybind.

Limitations
----
The plugin only generates PHPUnit syntax for now.

Also, check out [the Sublime Text version](https://github.com/bogdananton/Sublime-testNameGenerator) for more information about the **testNameGenerator** project.
